The file daner_pgc_mdd_meta_w2_no23andMe_rmUKBB.gz contains summary statistics from a genome-wide association meta-analysis of depression.


The meta-analysis was conducted using the core 29 PGC MDD2 cohorts plus deCODE, Generation Scotland, GERA, and iPSYCH cohorts (as described in Wray et al. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3), but without UK Biobank or 23andMe sumstats, and with individual overlap between PGC cohorts and UK Biobank removed.

The meta-analysis consisted of 45,396 cases and 97,250 controls and 9,884,712 variants. The file is in the "daner" format as specified: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWIhr8-qpCXB13WCXcU1_HDio8lC_MeWoAg2jlggrtU/

A notebook describing the analysis is available at https://psychiatric-genomics-consortium.github.io/mdd-rmUKBB/
